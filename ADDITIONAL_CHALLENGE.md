# Additional challenge

Considering our opportunities at Kelvin, we also would like to understand your skills on frontend testing side.
 
We would like to ask you to automate some tests that validates the creation of a google calendar event. In that way you must choose a testing framework (preferably one of the most trendy/modern) that you consider the best to test this form and behavior.

## Requirements:

- The calendar form shall allow the creation of an event selecting the date and time of the event.
- The event creation shall allow the user to select and/ or customize a notification.
- When correctly saved the event, it shall appear in the calendar form.

## Note

To test you can use this dummy google account that already allows you to login with an automated testing software:
 - account: testeuichallenge@gmail.com
 - password: 123456789qwerty.
